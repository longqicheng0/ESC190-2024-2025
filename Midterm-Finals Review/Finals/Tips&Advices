HI, good job you are almost there!

umm final's gonna hit hard, but dont worry if you dont go to lecture and eveyrthing, me2, here are some advice:

  1. catchup on the labs for sure, questions on the finals would be slightly easier than labs
  2. there would be a few topics thats REALLY challenging:
      a. Dijkstra's algorithm
      b. Dynamic programming
      c. graph related question?
    usually these 3 are the biggest quesiton on the test, in my year theres also a neural network question but that one i considered as ok

  3. do past finals -- !!!FOCUS ON THE EASY QUESTIONS ONLY 1-6!!! make sure you really understand the basics so at least you will be above average
  4. do past finals hard questions from the same prof - usually there would be a trend
  5. do leetcode - if you are bored: usually this is for the top students but thats not my goal so i never did this lol
        but leetcode is also good for daily questions if ur into it.........
